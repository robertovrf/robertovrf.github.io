			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil, where I research Emergent Software Systems for Smart Cities. In the past, I worked as a Research Associate at Lancaster University, UK (2017-2020), and I was a Visiting Researcher at IRISA/INRIA Université de Rennes 1, in France, during the summer of 2019. I obtained a PhD degree in Computer Science from Lancaster University, in 2018, and I hold an MSc and a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goiás (2013).</p>

			<h3>Research interests</h3>
			<p>I am interested in developing large-scale systems that can self-design at runtime to meet their user-defined goals in situations where their executing environment continually changes. Achieving this vision mainly entails abstracting many aspects of a system's design into a simple action/reward matrix to be used by reinforcement learning algorithms during the system's lifetime. I have applied this concept to create the very first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBNvbC6w_3Y" target="_blank">self-designing web-serving infrastructure</a> that can autonomously optimise their performance when subjected to varying workloads. Self-designing systems actively experiment with different ways in which to assemble their internal components to maximise the satisfaction of their goals. Further to that, I have been currently investigating how to apply the same concept to microservices, IoT systems and web cache applications. For more information on these topics, please refer to my full <a href="publications.html">publication list</a>.</p>
