			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Networks Laboratory (LRC) at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil. I research self-adaptive and autonomic computing techniques for service placement and resource allocation in the edge-cloud continuum to support video streaming applications. Prior to that, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil (2020-2022), where I studied Autonomous Composition of Software for Smart Cities. I was also a Research Associate at Lancaster University, UK (2017-2020), where I conducted research on Distributed Emergent Systems for Data Centers. During my time at Lancaster as a Researcher, I spent the summer of 2019 as a Visiting Researcher at IRISA/INRIA Université de Rennes 1, in France. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Lancaster University in 2018, and I hold an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goiás (2013).</p>

			<h3>Research interests</h3>
			<p>I am interested in developing large-scale systems that can self-design at runtime to meet their user-defined goals in situations where their executing environment continually changes. Achieving this vision mainly entails abstracting many aspects of a system's design into a simple action/reward matrix to be used by reinforcement learning algorithms during the system's lifetime. I have applied this concept to create the very first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBNvbC6w_3Y" target="_blank">self-designing web-serving infrastructure</a> that can autonomously optimise their performance when subjected to varying workloads. Self-designing systems actively experiment with different ways in which to assemble their internal components to maximise the satisfaction of their goals. Further to that, I have been currently investigating how to apply the same concept to microservices, IoT systems and web cache applications. For more information on these topics, please refer to my full <a href="publications.html">publication list</a>.</p>
